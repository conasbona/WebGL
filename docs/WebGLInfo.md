WebGL Fingerprinting Spoofing ‚Äì Background & Strategy
üìå What Is WebGL Fingerprinting?
WebGL fingerprinting is a method used to uniquely identify devices by probing the behavior of the WebGL API in the browser. It works by:

Querying GPU-related parameters via getParameter() and getShaderPrecisionFormat()

Enumerating available extensions with getSupportedExtensions()

Rendering a canvas scene (e.g. a 3D object or shader effect) and reading it via readPixels() or toDataURL()

Hashing the resulting image or metrics to generate a unique fingerprint

The technique is resistant to traditional privacy tools like VPNs, cookie blockers, or IP randomizers. It‚Äôs part of the broader set of device fingerprinting methods used in surveillance pricing, behavioral profiling, and fraud detection.

üß† Our Design Process
‚ùå What We Ruled Out
API Return Spoofing
Overriding methods like getParameter or getExtension can easily break websites and are detectable via value-time inconsistencies. Fingerprinting vendors like FingerprintJS actively flag spoofed values, so this strategy was rejected.

Extension Blocking
While blocking certain extensions (e.g., WEBGL_debug_renderer_info) is common, it is insufficient on its own. It merely signals that spoofing is happening without actually stopping fingerprint entropy from leaking via render output.

‚úÖ What We Explored
We modeled the solution after our successful canvas fingerprinting module, which adds deterministic noise to image data during getImageData() and toDataURL().

We considered two possible extensions of this concept to WebGL:

Option 1: Passive Mutation
Add noise only at the time of output (readPixels, toDataURL) by drawing over the framebuffer.

Option 2: Draw Interception
Hook draw calls (drawArrays, drawElements) and modify the shader pipeline to inject noise during rendering.

üéØ Final Decision: Hybrid Spoofing Model
We adopted a hybrid of Options 1 and 2:

Hook draw calls and inject a full-screen quad with a noise shader.

Fallback buffer mutation on readPixels() and toDataURL() if no draw calls were seen.

Use a session-seeded PRNG to ensure deterministic perturbation for each browsing instance.

This design avoids spoofing return values and instead modifies the observable side effects of rendering‚Äîmaking it ideal for defeating fingerprinting without breaking page behavior.

üîç Key Benefits of This Strategy
Feature	Benefit
Shader-level perturbation	Matches what fingerprinting scripts actually measure
Session consistency	Same hash across all tabs for a session, different across sessions
Realistic entropy	Noise patterns still look plausible, avoiding easy classification
Clean integration	Compatible with canvas spoofing and other fingerprint controls
Non-invasive spoofing	Preserves WebGL API behavior, just perturbs rendered output

üîß Implementation Summary
Hook: getContext, drawArrays, drawElements, readPixels, toDataURL

Inject noise shader during draw calls (full-screen quad with uniform seed)

Fallback: mutate pixels if no shader was run

Configurable noise levels via config.js

Controlled via session-seeded PRNG (prng.js)
